### Orchid is a Jekyll theme.

A tribute to Twenty Twelve and Twenty eleven.

I like wordpress's theme Twenty Twelve and Twenty eleven very much. 
So I called my Jekyll theme Orchid (Orchid <q>twenty-first</q> , it means twenty-first century, not twenty-one), this theme is based on my former theme [Orchid](https://github.com/erfajo/OrchidForDynamo).


<cite>Proudly enjoy using Orchid theme.</cite> <code>;)</code>
